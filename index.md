### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1, was an excellent lab for learning about double functions, as we used “int” before. It was a pretty simple switch from that to using double to get decimal numbers. The lab required us to perform conversions, from milliliters to tablespoons, adding an engaging aspect to the learning process as I did not have good coding skills during the first couple of labs. 


* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, was one of my favorites because learning how to code a game was interesting. Throughout the lab, I understood these functions and how they worked with my partner. Lab 6, part 2 was challenging as I am new to coding, though with my partner's help, it felt great getting it done. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1, was fascinating as the goal was to make a word game (Mad Libs). This lab was fun to do as it was short; however, it helped me understand how to use arguments and if statements better. Previously, I was not too sure how to initialize arguments without assistance.
